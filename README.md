# ALgorithm Simulator
It is designed to aid programmers in understanding, practicing, and visualizing various algorithms and data
structures commonly used in programming. 
Supported Algorithms: The simulator supports a wide range of algorithms, which
are:

 Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort.
 Searching algorithms: Binary Search, Linear Search.
 Singly LinkedList: Insertion at beginning, Deletion at beginning, Insertion at end,
Deletion at end.
 Problem: Sub array with given sum. 

Visualization: The simulator provides a user-friendly visualization of the data
structures and algorithms. It offers step-by-step visualizations to help users understand
how each algorithm operates on the data.

Console-Based Interface: The simulator incorporates a console-based interface,
enabling users to seamlessly interact with the simulator through command-line inputs
while observing the algorithm simulations in the console environment.
